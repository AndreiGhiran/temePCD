Scripts syntax:

    TCP_Client syntax: TCP_Client <server_addres> (connects to serve at <server_addres>, reads lines from messages.txt and sends them to the server)
    TCP_Server syntax: TCP_Server (receives messages from clients and counts the number and size of said messages)
    populate syntax: populate <number_of_messages> (generates <number_of_messages> mesages in messages.txt)

First run:
    in command line run:
        make all
        populate <number_of_messages> (replace <number_of_messages> with desired number of messages to be sent to the server)
        TCP_Server
        TCP_Client <server_addres> (replace <server_addres> with 127.0.0.1 for local testing or with your server's ip addres if you are running it remote)

Interesting findings during "development":
-Sometimes the server would read empty bytes from the buffer and count them as received messages, i had to treat this case so that 
    it stops reading from the buffer when it gets an ampty string.
-I tested the TCP server and client over my home LAN and I noted that when it transmits data locally it is mutch faster then when it transmits it over
    LAN. Using the local adress 15000001 messages consisting of 615098118 bytes were transmitted in 28 seconds with no losses, while when transmitting 
    over LAN the same amount of data was transmitted in 316 seconds (a little ove 5 minutes).
